Rage
In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
W hile raging, you gain the following benefits if you
aren’t w earing heavy armor:

You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws.

When you make a melee weapon attack using
Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
in the Rage Damage colum n of the Barbarian table.

You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
concentrate on them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown
for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
can rage again.

Unarmored Defense
W hile you are not wearing any armor, your Arm or Class
equals 10 + your Dexterity m odifier + your Constitution
modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Reckless Attack
Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
for defense to attack with fierce desperation. W hen
you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
to attack recklessly. D oing so gives you advantage on
m elee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
your next turn.

Danger Sense
At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things
nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge
when you dodge away from danger.
You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.
To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or
incapacitated.

Primal Path
At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of
your rage. C hoose the Path of the Berserker or the Path
of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the end of the
class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

Extra Attack
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of
once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Fast Movement
Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet
while you aren’t w earing heavy armor.

Feral Instinct
By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
advantage on initiative rolls.
Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
com bat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally
on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before
doing anything else on that turn.

Brutal Critical
Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
weapon damage die when determining the extra
damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
This increases to two additional dice at 13th level
and three additional dice at 17th level.

Relentless Rage
Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting
despite grievous w ounds. If you drop to 0 hit points
while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you
drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC
increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
DC resets to 10.

Persistent Rage
Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that
it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you
choose to end it.

Indomitable Might
Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength
check is less than your Strength score, you can use that
score in place of the total.

Primal Champion
At 20th level, you em body the power of the wilds. Your
Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your
maximum for those scores is now 24.
