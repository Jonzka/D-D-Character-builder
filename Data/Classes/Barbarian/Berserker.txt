Path of the Berserker
For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end -— that
end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path
of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter
the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle,
heedless of your own health or well-being.

Frenzy
Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you
can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for
the duration of your rage you can make a single melee
weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns
after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
of exhaustion.

Mindless Rage
Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charm ed or
frightened while raging. If you are charm ed or
frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
suspended for the duration of the rage.

Intimidating Presence
Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to
frighten som eone with your menacing presence.
W hen you do so, choose one creature that you can see
within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear
you, it must succeed on a W isdom saving throw (DC
equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your
next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action
to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened

Retaliation
Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from
a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use
your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against
that creature.
