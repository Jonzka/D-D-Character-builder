[Description]
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of
at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming wods, there are two knids of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.
