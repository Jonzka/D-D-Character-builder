Alignment. Elves love freedom , variety, and self-
expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler
aspects of chaos. They value and protect others'
freedom as well as their own, and they are more
often good than not. The drow are an exception; their
exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and
dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.
